Requirements: 
------------
Python2.X

Usage:
-----
Launch Server:
    >$ python2 SuperServer.py


Launch Client:
    >$ python2 SimpleClient.py

Inner working:
-------------
The server listens on localhost, port 9000, the client attempts to connect to the same address, and sends a request with the following syntax:

"login=xxx1 pos=0.0,0.0,1 destination=0.0,0.1,1 instructions=please"

The server saves this data in a dict, simulates processing, and simply answers: "Just go ahead and leave me alone, please"
