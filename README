Requirements: 
------------
Python2.X

Usage:
-----
Launch Server:
    >$ python2 SuperServer.py


Launch Client:
    >$ python2 SimpleClient.py

Inner working:
-------------
The server listens on localhost, port 9000, the client attempts to connect to the same address, and sends 10 threaded requests with the following syntax:

"login=xxx%d pos=0.0,0.0,1 destination=0.0,0.%d,1 instructions=please" % (id, id)

The server launches a thread per socket coonection, each one saves the data extracted from each request in a dict, simulates processing, and simply answers: "Just go ahead and leave me alone, please", or "Your reached your destination" if both pos and destination are the same in the request.
